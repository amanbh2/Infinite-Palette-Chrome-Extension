# Infinite-Palette-Chrome-Extension
Generate unique color palette at each click.

#Introduction

Hey Designers!

Welcome to Infinite Palette, an extension for chrome browser and your needs. Where you can generate unique palette at each click.
Just open the extension and whoa! there is your unique colour palette.
Not happy with the current combination. No issues we got you! Click on the refresh button to generate a new palette.
You can also change individual colour strips. Keep changing till you find your perfect match.
Got your right match! Time to use it in your project, just you need to click on the hex code to copy it to your clipboard. It's that easy.
We also have two handpicked colour palettes for you.
The first one is especially for your upcoming valentine project, which you can access by clicking on the "heart" icon.
The second one is for your dark theme designs, accessible by clicking on the "moon" icon.
You can also temporarily save your fresh colour palette, by clicking on the "Add" icon. This saved palette can be accessed by clicking on the "heart" icon.
All of this will work even if you are not connected to the internet, i.e. always available on your demand.
